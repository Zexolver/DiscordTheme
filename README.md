<h2>About</h2>

This is my first Discord theme, meant to create a somewhat similar look of the code of the Murder Drones (the show on YouTube) Visors.

<h2>Installation</h2>

Installing discord themes is quite easy
- Go into discord's settings
- Go to "Themes"
- Click on "Open theme folder"
- Move the .theme.css file you downloaded into the folder you just opened
- Click the checkbox in the top-right corner of the theme in discord to enable it
